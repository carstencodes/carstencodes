### Hi there :wave:

I'm Carsten. I'm working for a mid-size hardware manufacturer and software company in Germany as a software architect. Since 2002, I've been using Linux :penguin: (from SuSE over Fedora to Ubuntu, Debian and Devuan) and therefore I'm a huge enthusiast regarding free and open source software. 

I have a masters degree in applied computer sciences (regarding electronic engineering) and I'm a licensed ham, so sometimes I am participating on amateur radio. As a matter of fact, I also love playing with hardware a lot, so I'm using some embedded computers like Raspberry PI, Latte Panda, CubieBoard etc. and love to play around with IoT and home automation.

My personal websites are [carstenigel.net](https://www.carstenigel.net), [dh8cj.de](https://www.dh8cj.de) and [a habitual dev](https://ahabitual.dev). 

I'm personally fond of distributed algorithms, programs and configurations. Therefore, I am mainly using methods like zeroconf/mdns, matrix chats and activity pub systems.

PS: My other software is hosted on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/carstencodes) :fox_face: or [on my own server](https://codefrom.ahabitual.dev/). So my list of projects here is not complete :open_mouth:
